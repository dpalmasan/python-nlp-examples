# Python NLP Examples

This repo will contain NLP examples, and paper's implementations of clasical algorithms/systems.

The `src` folder contains code, currently:

* A simple implementation of [An Analysis of the AskMSR Question-Answering System](https://aclanthology.org/W02-1033.pdf) is under `ask_msr` and can be run via `poetry run python driver/qa_system_example.py`. It uses bing as the backend IR system.
* A simple language generator using HMM, using the [AnCora Corpus](http://clic.ub.edu/corpus/en)
